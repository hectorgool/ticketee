In order for assets to be served correctly in the production environment while running a rails server session, you need to go into the config/environments/production.rb file and change this line,

config.serve_static_files = ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'].present?
to this:
config.serve_static_files = true

SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret` rails s -e production
